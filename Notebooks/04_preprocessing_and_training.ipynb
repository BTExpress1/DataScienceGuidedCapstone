    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that.

    "After loading ski_data from the EDA step, I removed the target resort (Big Mountain Resort) from the data set updating ski_data and saving Big Mountain Resort as big_mountain  for later use. The next step is to split ski_data into train and test at 70/30 ratio. This will help us achieve an independent test set that will not be used for training, hence providing an independent assessment. The test data will also help us avoid overfitting. After the split, it was important to have numeric features only. To achieve this, I saved the X_train and X_test of none numeric featues as named lists and dropped them from the rest of the X_train and X_test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier steps, the assumption was that average price will play a part in driving to a solution to our problem. Assuming that average price is a best guess, I calculated the mean y_train. Using DummyRegressor, I validated the train mean. The next step is to use metrics, specifically R2, to measure performance.   By creating an array of length the size of the training set with a single value of the mean, the result continues to match and be promising. Using the training set mean, I created an array of length the size of the test set with a single value. By using this prediction, we have an R2 that is close to zero but negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute error and mean squared error are better metrics to measure how close our predictions are to true values. I need to remember the mean squared error is large because it gives a  squared value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to missing values, there are different ways to impute them. One way is to learn the value of imputing from the train set. Then, the imputation is applied to both train and test sets using the median. I trained the model on the train split using a leaner regression model, made predictions using the model on train and test splits, and assessed the model performance. This gave us an over 80% variance on the train split and over 70% variance on the test split. The result is an estimate of the ticket price to be within $9 of the real price. $9 is better than the $19 from guessing with just the average.  The results were not that different when the mean was used to impute missing values. To check for overtraining, other feature transformations should be explored. I employed pipeline and found similar results. Different pipelines were tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Model prevents repeated performance checks on the test split. We can go straight from defining the pipeline to assessing the performance through cross-validation, which will perform the fitting as part of the process. I used hyperparameters with and without feature scaling on the mean and median to impute missing values. I discovered imputing with the median is better, without scaling the features. A barplot of the random forest feature importance aligns with what we have done so far—the top four features as fastQuads, Runs, Snow_making_ac, and vertical_drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make a decision on the final model, I calculated the mean absolute error for the two models, the best linear model and the random forest model. Since cross-validation defaults to R2, I specified the mean absolute error as an alternative through the scoring parameter. The random forest has less variability and lower cross-validation mean absolute error. The final exercise is to determine if additional data needs to be collected. The learning_curve function shows that model scores have a sharp rise at the low end of the sample size and flatten around 50. We have enough data, and we should avoid spending money on additional data. The best model is saved for the next step. \n",
